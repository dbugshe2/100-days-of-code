# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 16 2018

**Today's Progress:** I started afresh because I've been lacking in consistency, and as they say, third times is  the charm, I started the Google developers code labs to learn how to build progressive web apps, as a part of an official project

**Thoughts:** It's very exciting I am now working under a deadline and I am more accountable for what I do.

### Day 2: July 17 2018

**Today's Progress:** I worked even further with my efforts to finish the code lab at the Google developers website, I learned more about how service workers work as well as caching, with a brief intro to caching strategies

**Thoughts:** I am fairly new to JavaScript and I think I need to have a firm grasp on certain features and concepts of the JavaScript. escpecially service workers,, promises, and caching.

### Day 3: July 18 2018

**Today's Progress:** today I decided to take the Udacity course on JavaScript promises, I spent most of my time today coding along I later hit a snag when i tried to install npm dependencies for the course project. and I installed CouchDB and learned a bit about how to set up CouchDB development on a windows machine.  

**Thoughts:** I'm learning about scrum and I want to personally apply it my learning and working, to hopefully learn make as much as I can.
